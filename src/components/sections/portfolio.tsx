                    Instead of deleting all those twitter jokes I get over the phone, I decided I
                    had to make them available to the world. Here you will find them (in Spanish).

                    This web application was also as an excuse to practice with CSS3 animation

                    After having developed a terrible Visual Basic desktop application in 2011 and

                    First attempt to build an online business! Along with <b>Eudald Bover</b> we
                    developed this restaurant discounts (up to 50%!) web app and managed to sell 150

                    We didn't get any summer job back in 2011 so we started to shape this platform
                    that we would launch the following year, after having signed up enough
                    restaurants. Originally built in PHP, I migrated it to Node.js after we closed
                    the website.

                    Web application that generates random sudoku puzzles and offers hints on how to
                    solve them. It can also be used to solve existing puzzles (e.g. one from a
                    newspaper), but it is not bulletproof; it might fail to find the solution.

                <p>
                    I decided to figure out by myself how to generate sudoku puzzles after having
                    been talking about it with my mom. The resulting application persists the
                    puzzle, so you can refresh page or close the browse without losing the progress.

                    I was developing a front end application at work and we interacted with a{' '}
                    <b>GraphQL Api</b>. I loved the standard, but I felt I wasn't learning enough
                    about the server side so I decided to built my own Api and get a better
                    understanding on how it works.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The result is a simple Api with the typical features used in any modern Api
                    (filtering, pagination, referenced entities, ordering, etc.), accessible through
                    a GraphiQL interface.

                    When I was in college I was asked to write a C++ algorithm to generate fractal
                    patterns. I spent far too many hours coding on it to settle with the miserable
                    command line output; some years later I turned the same algorithm into a
                    visually pleasant web app.

                    <b>https://michael.page</b> and resell it to the british recruitment business.
                    We invested 700€. We got 0€ ROI.

                    Pretty straightforward application providing company information. Built in

                    page reloads and filtering the product catalog by the selected part of the SVG
                    pig image.

                    I hadn't heard about <b>single page applications</b> when I developed this web

                    the most effective approach. Originally built in PHP and migrated to Node.js
