You've had a look at the multiple options available and still you are unsure which one to go for. Regardless where you are at now this is all you need to know before implementing push notifications on your managed Expo app and how to do so in August 2021.</p><h3>Introduction</h3><h4>Notification gateways</h4><p>Ultimately notifications reach users' devices through push notification gateways: FCM (Firebase Cloud Messaging) for Android devices and APNs (Apple Push Notification service) for iOS devices. Both gateways are services that expose a Web API for sending push notifications to users through HTTP requests.</p><p>We don't need to know more about these gateways but using them is the only way to deliver push notifications to our users. We will need to configure both FCM and APNs credentials and call their APIs for our app to successfully deliver notifications.</p><h4>Push tokens</h4><p>A push token is a unique key that identifies an app installed in a specific device. Push tokens are issued by the Apple or Google push notification gateways and allow delivering the messages only to the intended app-device combination. Their format changes depending on the operating system but they look something like <span class="article-inline-snippet">03df25c845d460b...f99cc3edcb63a85ea2ef2</span>.</p><h4>Server side requirements</h4><p>Any form of messaging involves a sender and a receiver and, in addition, the sender needs to know the receiver's ID in order to locate them. When it comes to push notifications the receiver's ID is their push token.</p><p>Users' push tokens will therefore need to be collected and stored somewhere prior to sending users notifications. While this doesn't necessarily mean you will need a backend server you will certainly need a trusted environment in which to store the push tokens and call the notification gateways API.</p><div><img class="article-image with-footer" src="/images/blog/expo-push-notifications/push-token-collection.png" alt="Push token collection"><p class="article-image-footer">Push token collection</p></div><p>If you are already leveraging a backend infrastructure it's definitely a good place to handle the notification-related operations. If you don't have such infrastructure and you want to keep it simple you can use serverless solutions.</p><div><img class="article-image with-footer" src="/images/blog/expo-push-notifications/push-token-notification.png" alt="Sending a push notification to a specific push token"><p class="article-image-footer">Sending a push notification to a specific push token</p></div><p><i>Notifications can also be sent to the entire audience of the app. If you don't need to send notifications to specific users you can then skip collecting push tokens and setting up a server side environment to send notifications from and use a graphical notifications composer tools instead (e.g. Firebase notification composer).</i></p><h3>Technical considerations</h3><h4>Push tokens collection: The Expo way</h4><p>Expo provides a great module for setting up and handling push notifications which not only works like a charm but it is also magnifically documented:<span class="article-inline-snippet">expo-notifications</span>. This is the module I'm going to be using to handle push notifications on the client side and it provides two different methods for collecting push tokens:</p><ul><li><b><a href="https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/sdk/notifications/#getdevicepushtokenasync-devicepushtoken" target="_blank">getDevicePushTokenAsync</a></b>: This method returns the device native push token, different for iOS and Android, and that's the token we will need to use when communicating directly with the notification gateways</li><li><b><a href="https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/sdk/notifications/#getexpopushtokenasyncoptions-expotokenoptions-expopushtoken" target="_blank">getExpoPushTokenAsync</a></b>: This method returns an Expo push token (something like <span class="article-inline-snippet">ExponentPushToken[lBc...ZsM]</span>), a custom token that Expo push notifications service uses to deliver notifications instead of the native push tokens. This is the method we need to use when using Expo's service</li></ul><h4>Push tokens collection: The Firebase way</h4><p>Firebase includes a messaging module that can be used to manage push notifications. According to the <a href="https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging/js/client" target="_blank">Firebase documentation</a>, <span class="article-inline-snippet">messaging.getToken</span> is the function we need to call in order to retrieve the device push token, which will first ask for notification permissions in case they have not been granted yet.</p><p>Unfortunately the Firebase messaging module is not compatible with React native üíî Long story short trying to call the messaging module will result in an unhandled exception (more details about this issue in this <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/61300018/typeerror-firebase-default-messaging-is-not-a-function-in-firebase-default-m/64855286#64855286" target="_blank">stackoverflow question</a>).</p><div class="article-block-snippet">firebase.default.messaging is not a function.

As explained in the <a href="https://docs.expo.dev/push-notifications/sending-notifications-custom" target="_blank">Expo docs</a> notification gateways direct communication requires handling certain complexity:</p><ul><li>Differentiating between native iOS &amp; Android device tokens</li><li>Twice the amount of code to write and maintain</li><li>FCM and APNs responses error handling</li></ul><p>We could of course handle such complexity but Expo happens to provide an iOS-agnostic push notification service that does handle it already. Plus we will be using <span class="article-inline-snippet">expo-notifications</span> to handle notifications on the client side so I feel using the Expo push notifications service makes a lot of sense (e.g. the notification <span class="article-inline-snippet">data</span> is automatically serialized and deserialized by Expo on both ends). This is how the service works:</p><div><img class="article-image" src="/images/blog/expo-push-notifications/expo-push-notifications-diagram.png" alt="Expo push notifications service diagram"></div><h3>Use case</h3><p>Before start coding we will need a use case for push notifications. Let's say we will create an app that allows users to subscribe to daily weather notifications. For the sake of simplicity we will start with a single city (e.g. Barcelona üï∂Ô∏è) and notifications will always be sent at the same hour (e.g. 8:00 am).</p><p>Apart from the subscribe/unsubscribe buttons the app will also include a "Send" button to receive a test notification on user demand. Users will be anonymous: we will only store users' ExpoPushToken so we can identify the devices that need to be notified on the scheduled time.</p><p>Upon notification received/clicked the app will display the notification content (I'll use a JSON Viewer for illustrative purposes) and a button to clear the notification out. The ExpoPushToken is also displayed so that user can use the <a href="https://expo.dev/notifications" target="_blank">Expo notifications tool</a> to send test notifications to his own device.</p><p>Because it's a demonstration only app we don't need to spend much time styling it.</p><div class="screen-splitter"><div><img class="article-image image-300" src="/images/blog/expo-push-notifications/use-case-screen-1.png" alt="App use case screenshot 1"></div><div><img class="article-image image-300" src="/images/blog/expo-push-notifications/use-case-screen-2.png" alt="App use case screenshot 2"></div></div><h3>Implementation: client side</h3><p>Handling push notifications on Expo is fairly simple. Let's go ahead and install the Expo notifications module. We will be using this module to:</p><div class="article-block-snippet">expo install expo-notifications</div><ul><li>Display received notifications. When a notification is received Expo calls the<span class="article-inline-snippet">handleNotification</span> function parameter we pass to<span class="article-inline-snippet">Notifications.setNotificationHandler</span> to decide whether the notification must be shown to the user</li><li>Update the app on notification received. Only if the app is <b>foregrounded</b> when a notification is received Expo will run the callback provided through<span class="article-inline-snippet">Notifications.addNotificationReceivedListener</span></li><li>Update the app on notification clicked. When the user clicks on a notification Expo will launch the app and run the callback provided through <span class="article-inline-snippet">Notifications.addNotificationResponseReceivedListener</span></li><li>Get the device push token</li></ul><p>For the following snippet to be as simple as possible I have extracted the server related functions in a separate file (i.e. <span class="article-inline-snippet">server-operations.ts</span>) and I have omitted all style tags.</p><iframe width="100%" frameborder="0" id="gist-f5713a2e5cd2a783ac58f23bbe8de8e4" style="height: 2875px;"></iframe><p>We then need to tweak the <span class="article-inline-snippet">app.json</span> file a bit by adding the <span class="article-inline-snippet">NOTIFICATIONS</span> permission and setting the <span class="article-inline-snippet">android.useNextNotificationsApi</span> to <span class="article-inline-snippet">true</span>.</p><iframe width="100%" frameborder="0" id="gist-e7617025298dbcc97ded69947acfbbc0" style="height: 345px;"></iframe><p>And that's all we need to get notifications working on the Expo Go client üçæ You can test them now by using the <a href="https://expo.dev/notifications" target="_blank">Expo notifications tool</a>, providing the ExpoPushToken that will be displayed in the app. Pressing the buttons on the app will not work until we implement the server side.</p><div class="screen-splitter"><div><img class="article-image" src="/images/blog/expo-push-notifications/expo-notifications-tool-form.png" alt="Expo notification tool send form"></div><div><img class="article-image image-300" src="/images/blog/expo-push-notifications/expo-notifications-tool-received.png" alt="Received notification from Expo notification tool"></div></div><p>About <span class="article-inline-snippet">server-operations.ts</span>, notice that server related operations will depend largely on the server side choices. Here is what the operations can look like when using Firebase Realtime database and Firebase Functions on the server side (omitting error management).</p><iframe width="100%" frameborder="0" id="gist-62e0dedda61461e6beaa138200e05b6c" style="height: 829px;"></iframe><p>Let's get ready for release now üöÄ When testing notifications in the Expo Go client we use Expo's FCM and APNs credentials but that's not going to do the trick when releasing the app. The next thing we need to do to get the push notifications working on a release version of our app (e.g. standalone version) is to configure and add both FCM and APNs credentials to the Expo app.</p><h4>Configuring APNs</h4><p>Since we are building on Expo it turns out to be really easy to configure APNs. All we need to do is launching the Expo credentials manager and choose from the options on the list.</p><div class="article-block-snippet">expo credentials:manager<br><br>Accessing credentials for &lt;...&gt; in project expo-notifications-tutorial<br><br>?

Be aware that you can only have two push notifications keys for the same Apple Developer account and those keys will be used across all of your apps.</p><p>Only create a new push notification key if you don't have any for your current Apple Developer account. Trying to create a third push notification key will result in an error message both from the Expo credentials manager and the Apple Developer Portal.</p><div class="article-block-snippet">‚úñ Failed to create Apple push key<br>CommandError:<br>You can have only two Apple Keys generated on your Apple Developer account.<br>Please revoke the old ones or reuse existing from your other apps.<br>Please remember that Apple Keys are not application specific!<br></div><div><img class="article-image with-footer" src="/images/blog/expo-push-notifications/apple-developer-portal-apns-key.png" alt="Apple Developer Portal error message"><p class="article-image-footer">Apple Developer Portal error message</p></div><p>Regardless reusing an existing key or creating a new one at the end of the process you should see a similar message to the one below.

This doesn't mean you will need to migrate your app to Firebase at all, but you do will need to create a Firebase project and add the Firebase credentials to your Expo app. Straight from <a href="https://docs.expo.dev/push-notifications/using-fcm/" target="_blank">this page of the Expo docs</a>:</p><ul><li>Choose your Firebase project. Either create a new project or use an already existing one. In both cases you will need to have Firebase added to your Android app (using the <span class="article-inline-snippet">android.package</span> value of your <span class="article-inline-snippet">app.json</span> file)<div><img class="article-image" src="/images/blog/expo-push-notifications/firebase-android-app.png" alt="Adding Firebase to the Android app"></div></li><li>Download the <span class="article-inline-snippet">google-services.json</span> file of your Firebase app and place it in your Expo app's root directory. It's a good idea to exclude this file from source control<div><img class="article-image" src="/images/blog/expo-push-notifications/firebase-google-services.png" alt="Downloading Firebase google-services.json file"></div></li><li>In your <span class="article-inline-snippet">app.json</span> file add an <span class="article-inline-snippet">android.googleServicesFile</span> field with the relative path to the <span class="article-inline-snippet">google-services.json</span> file you just downloaded<iframe width="100%" frameborder="0" id="gist-825ea2eb3d9a2bd94af5c936ed97dbb4" style="height: 323px;"></iframe></li><li>Rebuild the app for Android, <span class="article-inline-snippet">expo build:android</span>, for the changes to take effect</li></ul><p><i>Skip the previous steps if you are already using Firebase in your app and you have previously added the <span class="article-inline-snippet">google-services.json</span> file.</i></p><p>That's all we need to do on the Expo app side but there is one more step we need to complete. Because we are using Expo notifications service instead of directly calling FCM we need to upload the Firebase project server key to Expo's servers, so Expo's service can provide the key for us when calling FCM.</p><div><img class="article-image" src="/images/blog/expo-push-notifications/firebase-server-key.png" alt="Obtaining Firebase server key"></div><p>The Firebase server key can be found in <b>Project settings</b> &gt; <b>Cloud Messaging</b> &gt; <b>Server key</b>. Once you locate the server key you need to run the following command to upload it to Expo's servers:</p><div class="article-block-snippet">expo push:android:upload --api-key AAA...jbQ</div><p>Afterwards you can again check the <b>Credentials</b> section of your app in <a href="https://expo.dev/" target="_blank">https://expo.dev/</a> to make sure the server key has been correctly uploaded.</p><div><img class="article-image" src="/images/blog/expo-push-notifications/expo-credentials-fcm-key.png" alt="FCM server key in Expo credentials section"></div><h3>Implementation: server side</h3><p>The most relevant task the server code needs to handle is composing and sending the push notifications. Because we are relying on Expo push notifications service we will use the Expo server SDK (the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/expo-server-sdk" target="_blank">Node.js flavour</a> since I'm coding in Typescript).</p><p><span class="article-inline-snippet">expo-server-sdk</span> exposes a method named <span class="article-inline-snippet">sendPushNotificationAsync</span> that receives an array of message objects and schedules the delivery of those messages to the corresponding notification gateways. The message objects must be formatted according to Expo. Both things can be done in a simple function like the one below (omitting error management).</p><iframe width="100%" frameborder="0" id="gist-32d5f14fbc00ce746b6545632060e0d6" style="height: 389px;"></iframe><p>About retrieving the push tokens we need to provide to the function, it depends again on the server side choices. Sticking to Firebase Realtime database and Firebase Functions it can be done like this:</p><iframe width="100%" frameborder="0" id="gist-549763f3f5679b20ebf750d91af8a700" style="height: 983px;"></iframe><p>This is not a Firebase tutorial so I'm not going to explain the code above with great detail. All we need to know is that creates a Cloud Scheduler job that runs every day and notifies the subscribed users and exposes an HTTPS endpoint that can be used to send individual notifications at any time.</p><p>Finally the only missing bit is the function to get the weather data. If you are curious about it such function can be implemented as an HTTPS call to the <a href="https://openweathermap.org/" target="_blank">Open Weather</a> web API providing the name of the corresponding city:</p><iframe width="100%" frameborder="0" id="gist-45d7b82690dbb8db8d2714acc0080e53" style="height: 389px;"></iframe><h3>Wrapping up</h3><p>Give yourself a round of applause üëè If you have made it this far your app should successfully be delivering push notifications on both Android and iOS devices. I'll finish this article by tackling a couple issues you might find while testing your app.</p><h4>Unhandled Firebase composer notification click</h4><p>Firebase has a notification composer that can be used to send notifications to the entire audience of an app. Sending notifications through this graphical tool will indeed deliver notifications to all the users of our app (on Android devices at least; I haven't tested it on iOS).</p><div class="screen-splitter"><div><img class="article-image with-footer" src="/images/blog/expo-push-notifications/firebase-notification-composer.png" alt="Firebase Cloud Messaging notification composer"><p class="article-image-footer">Firebase Cloud Messaging notification composer</p></div><div><img class="article-image image-300" src="/images/blog/expo-push-notifications/firebase-notification-received.png" alt="Received notification from Firebase composer"></div></div><p>An unpleasant surprise appears when clicking on the notification however: the app opens but Expo notification handlers are not fired, causing the notification click to be missed üò¢ At first it might look like an Expo bug but after reading through the Expo's repository issues we discover it's actually the expected behavior.</p><p>As explained <a href="https://github.com/expo/expo/issues/10789#issuecomment-716624242" target="_blank">in this comment</a> there are two types of FCM notifications: data messages and notification messages. Having a look at the <a href="https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging/concept-options#notifications_and_data_messages" target="_blank">provided Firebase documentation page</a> we find the cause of the problem:</p><div class="article-block-snippet">With FCM, you can send two types of messages to clients:<br><br>Notification messages, sometimes thought of as "display messages." These are handled by the FCM SDK automatically.<br><br>Data messages, which are handled by the client app.</div><p>So no room for Expo to handle the Firebase composer notifications. We will have to live with that and write some more code for the cases in which we need to notify the entire audience of the app.</p><h4>Unhandled notification click on app launch (on Android)</h4><p>In the code above we are defining the notifications handlers from a <span class="article-inline-snippet">useEffect</span> inside the App component given we need React to update the app to display the content of the received notifications.</p><p>There's nothing wrong with it but, as explained in <a href="https://github.com/expo/expo/issues/6943#issuecomment-677901678" target="_blank">this github issue</a>, if the handlers are not defined as soon as possible upon app launch the notification click might go unnoticed when launching the app from closed state. That's exactly what occurs now when clicking on a notification while the app is in closed state.</p><p>Luckily this issue can be worked around. A simple way is to define stub notification handlers on app launch, outside any component, and define the the actual handlers' behavior later on (e.g. from a <span class="article-inline-snippet">useEffect</span> inside a component). The catch to this approach is that stub handlers allow us to track notifications received before the actual handler's behavior is defined.</p><p>Looks easier than it sounds and, elegant or not, it works üí™:</p><iframe width="100%" frameborder="0" id="gist-fe3e1dad37b9ec8a19ee336339fe87c8" style="height: 1533px;"></iframe><p>And that's the end of it! You can find all the source code you might need to check in <a href="https://github.com/capelski/expo-notifications-tutorial" target="_blank">this repository</a>.
