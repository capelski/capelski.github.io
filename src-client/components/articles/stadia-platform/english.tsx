            Looking for fresh entertainment? Google is here with a new gaming platform that delivers
            4K and doesn't require a console. Give it a chance and try it for free in your computer
            by just signing up with your google account. You will be playing in 5 minutes and the
            graphics will blow your mind ðŸ¤¯ Have a look at the screenshots at the end of the post if
            you still have any doubt!

                First things first! <b>Stadia is not free forever</b>. You can try it free of charge
                for a month, but you will then be billed 9.99â‚¬ on a monthly basis. I'm usually not a
                fan of this free trial like strategies (I rather prefer to get a limited version of
                the service for free and then having the chance to unlock additional features by
                upgrading),{' '}
                <b>but I must recognize that Stadia gaming experience is worth trialing</b> even if
                you are resolved not to buy.
            </p>
            <p>
                And <i>"why is it worth trailing?"</i> I can hear you asking to yourself. Leaving
                aside the great video game experience itself, the most interesting aspect from my
                point of view is the fact that you can play from your computer without installing
                any software. It might seem an irrelevant detail, but let's keep in mind that a very
                similar idea turned{' '}

                from an online pay-per-rent DVD rental company to one of the biggest streaming
                provider in the world. <b>Stadia could be the end of consoles obsolescence</b> (e.g.
                Play Station 1, Play Station 2, Play Station 3... and the list goes on).

                Another promising feature, which I haven't tested out personally, is that{' '}
                <b>it can be played in multiple devices such as smartphones, tablets and TVs</b>. I
                tried playing from my low range smartphone but, even though the game managed to
                start, the Xiamoi Redmi 5 is not powerful enough to keep the pace. You can check
                whether your device is supported in Stadia's website. Also notice that for an
                optimal game experience they recommend using the{' '}

                (sold for 69â‚¬ at the time of writing), compatible with all device types and

                On the other hand, <b>Stadia has a couple downsides</b>. First and more important:{' '}
                <b>the games still need to purchased one by one</b>. You will get some for free when
                you sign up so you can test the platform, but if you want to play any game out of
                that selection you will need to pay for it separately. I didn't care much about
                which game to play so I tested out the four of them, being{' '}
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Destiny_2" target="_blank">
                    Destiny 2
                </a>{' '}
                the only one I really enjoyed (and almost got addicted to). I found other
                interesting titles, but too expensive in my opinion. I was expecting Stadia to go
                for a Spotify-like approach and include all the titles in the monthly subscription.
                I won't argue whether there are enough available video games or not because I trust
                the list will grow as the time goes by, as well as the number of players in the
                community

            />
            <p>
                Another issue I do must point out are the <b>recurrent disconnections</b> I've been
                suffering <b>while playing</b>, most of the times getting a black screen with no
                error message at all. I couldn't find a way to solve it in Stadia forum and, while

                . I was using a 92Mbps wired internet connection in both cases, so bandwidth was
                clearly not the problem here. This issue is particularly annoying because the game
                keeps running in Stadia servers in the meanwhile, so you can be sure you will have
                died by the time you reconnect.

            <p>
                That being said I still believe is worth giving Stadia a chance. Maybe it won't
                reach Netflix success, but it can definitely shift the video games industry
                direction for good. No matter you are a tech enthusiast, an unconditional video game
                player or just a curious person, taking advantage of this free month won't hurt you
                (you can easily cancel the subscription when the time arrives) and it will give you
                a clue of what the future of the video games might look like.
