            As a software engineer I am quite used to <b>project management</b> practice. With it's{' '}

        <React.Fragment>
            <p>
                One of this techniques is called Kanban, an{' '}
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development" target="_blank">
                    Agile methodology
                </a>{' '}
                that, as many others, helps breaking a big and complex problem into small managable
                tasks and tackling them iteratively over time. The interesting aspect of Kanban is
                how this tasks get layed out in the Kanban board.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Kanban board consists in a set of columns which always include but are not
                limited to the following three: <b>Pending</b>,<b>In Progress</b> and <b>Done</b>.
                The three columns can have any names and you might find any number of additional
                columns (e.g. in software engineering we add columns to represent the different
                stages of a task development: implementation, testing, deployment, etc.). This is an
                empty Kanban board:
            </p>
            <div className="kanban-board">
                <div>
                    <div className="kanban-board-header">Pending</div>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <div className="kanban-board-header">In Progress</div>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <div className="kanban-board-header">Done</div>
                </div>
            </div>
            <p>
                When a new goal appears it always enters the Pending column, thus this column
                becomes the list of all the goals that need to be completed someday. The Pending
                column is sorted by priority, having the tasks that needs to be completed first in
                the very top. Let's turn the empty Kanban board into my personal goals Kanban board
                and add a few of them:
            </p>
            <div className="kanban-board">
                <div>
                    <div className="kanban-board-header">Pending</div>
                    <p>Write post about Kanban</p>
                    <p>Join CrossFit classes</p>
                    <p>Start playing the guitar</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <div className="kanban-board-header">In Progress</div>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <div className="kanban-board-header">Done</div>
                </div>
            </div>
            <p>
                When we start working in any of the goals from the Pending column we move it into
                the In Progress column. One of the key principles to keep Kanban effective is to
                limit the number of tasks in the In Progress column. You will find the limit through
                trial and error but somewhat around 5 makes sense for most of the cases. I am
                currently working in the first task of the board so let's keep things updated:
            </p>
            <div className="kanban-board">
                <div>
                    <div className="kanban-board-header">Pending</div>
                    <p>Join CrossFit classes</p>
                    <p>Start playing the guitar</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <div className="kanban-board-header">In Progress</div>
                    <p>Write post about Kanban</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <div className="kanban-board-header">Done</div>
                </div>
            </div>
            <p>
                As you have already guessed, once I finish writing this post I will move the task to
                the Done column, which becomes a historical register of all the goals that you have
                completed. And that's the Kanban theory in a nutshell! There are many online tools
                you can use to represent a Kanban board and the one I like the most is{' '}
                <a href="https://trello.com/" target="_blank">
                    Trello
                </a>
                . Trello boards can have any number of lists and each list contains cards that are
                much more powerful than just plain text: you can attach pictures, you can share
                them, you can label them, you can create check lists, etc. This is what my books
                Kanban board looks like in Trello:
            </p>
            <ArticleImage
                articleId={ArticleId.kanbanGoalsTracking}
                alt="Kanban board in Trello"
                filename="trello-board.png"
            />
            <p>
                This is it! Simple but effective Kanban helps you managing and tracking your
                personal goals. If you still keeping your todos in a messy text file, give it a try
                and surrender to it's simplicity ðŸ’ª See you in the next post!
